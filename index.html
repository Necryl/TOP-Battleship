You can place your ships on your board. The enemy will do the same.</p><p>To place a ship you need to select it. Click one of the grey blocks on your side of the board to select a ship. When a ship is selected it gets a blue outline. If you are on mobile, you can click on the board and drag to position your ship. If you are on a desktop/laptop, you can right-click on the board to change the orientation of your ship.</p><p>At the beginning of the game neither of you can see the other's ships or their positions.</p><p>Now you can click on the "Start" button to start the game. Each player takes turn to fire at a cell in the enemy board. To do this, simply click on a cell in the enemy board. If you get a hit, that cell will turn black. Else it will turn blue.</p><p>Once you hit a ship, don't forget to fire at the cells around it to hit the rest of the ship. The ships are only one cell wide but they can be upto four cells long!</p><p>Once all the cells of the ship are hit, the ship turns red to indicate that it has sunk.</p><p>Also there are status indicators for both players that show which ships are remaining and which have sunk.</p><p>Once the enemy loses all of their ships, you win the game!</p><p>Let's get started!</p><p>Extra Information:</p><p>The "Randomize" button under your board will place ships randomly across your board, although it is not very strategic.</p><p>The "Reset" button will clear your board so you place the ships in a new way. Keep in mind, you can always select a ship and click on an empty cell on the board to reposition it.</p></div></div></body></html>
